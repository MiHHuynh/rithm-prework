<!--Introduction-->
<section class="introduction">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I spend most of my money on things that will make me sparkle, smell good, or feel full (go figure). I like to document said items and binge-post on instagram.</p>
  <p>I also love picking up heavy metal objects and putting up back down, or putting them on my back and doing up and down movements. (I was trying to find an interesting way to describe lifting.) When I remember to renew my membership, I also try to beat up heavy bags, kick shields, and occasionally other people at least 3 days a week at a krav maga gym.</p>
  <p>I enjoy learning and all things internet. I spend most of my waking hours on the computer! You can often find me reading something online to gain more knowledge in any and every subject. Falling into the Wikipedia rabbithole (clicking one link after another) and absorbing things that I previously did not know is one of my favorite pastimes. Also, needless to say, I love to code. It's what I do willingly for fun (computer, internet, and learning; how much better can it get?).</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I was born and raised in San Jose, but because I was mostly a homebody through grade school, I unfortunately don't know the area as well as Los Angeles, which is where I spent my college years.</p>
  <p>Culturally, I am fully Vietnamese, but according to 23andme, I'm more than 3/4 Chinese. How interesting!</p>
