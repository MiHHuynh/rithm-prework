/*Part I
Answer the following questions

What is an em?

An em is a unit that is equivalent to the default font-size for the element.

What is the difference between em and rem?

While the em will change depending on what the default font-size for the element is,
rem is a unit that is only relative to the root element (i.e. html), which makes it
the same size anywhere in the page.

What is "mobile first" design?

"Mobile first" design is design that is implemented to fit mobile screens first.
Back in the day, people used to design for laptops and larger screens, but that would
almost never translate to a decent design on mobile. Nowadays, most people are viewing
things on their phones, so going by "mobile first," one can ensure that the app or site
is usable and viewable on mobile before adapting it to web/laptops.

What is BEM?

BEM stands for Block, Element, and Modifier. It is a way of organizing
CSS to make it more maintainable. It aims to avoid inheritance and provide
some sort of scope to the CSS and to reduce style conflicts by minimizing
specificity.
