## Rithm Prework

These are my solutions to the following online courses from Rithm (all of the below and many more can be found [here](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses)):

* [Terminal and Unix](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/terminal)
* [Git and Github](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/git)
* [HTML + CSS Basics](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/html-css-fundamentals)
* [Intermediate CSS](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/intermediate-css-bootstrap)
* [Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/javascript)
* [Intermediate JavaScript I](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/intermediate-javascript)
* [Intermediate JavaScript II](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/intermediate-javascript-part-2)

All the files containing my solutions are separated into folders, with each folder representing a course. File types are chosen according to what I think would fit best with the solutions to the questions asked for that particular section. For example, if a section asked mostly questions about terminology, the file containing the solutions would be a `.txt` file. Likewise, a section that contained exercises that required me to write a bunch of JS functions would have all the solutions presented in a `.js` file.

Things can get a little hairy when it comes to larger projects that require multiple files for a single solution to a project (e.g. a styled page with some interactivity would need an `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` file). I have not quite decided how I want to do that yet, but for the sake of having everything in one place/repo, I might just create another subfolder inside the course superfolder to store all related files for a project.

Stay tuned...
