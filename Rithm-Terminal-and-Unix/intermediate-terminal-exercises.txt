{ Intermediate Terminal Exercises. }

Part I
Answer the following questions:

-Create an environment variable called FIRST_NAME and set it equal to your first name (this does not need to be permanent)

export FIRST_NAME=Michelle

-Print the FIRST_NAME variable

echo $FIRST_NAME

-Print out the $PATH variable

echo $PATH

-What is the $PATH variable?

The $PATH variable is where the terminal goes to find programs to execute.

-Why would you want to create an environment variable?

It is a useful way to save information about the environment you are working on.

-How do you permanently save environment variables?

You need to save the command into the shell configuration file in your home directory.

-What is a process?

A process is a program that is being run on your computer.

-How do you list all processes running on your machine?

You type the command "ps aux".

-What is a PID?

The PID is the process ID, which is a unique identifier for each process.

-How do you terminate a process?

kill <PID>

-What is the difference between kill and kill -9?

kill sends out a TERM signal by default. If a program has crashed or frozen, it is possible that the signal won't be received and the process will not terminate. kill -9 sends a "non-catchable, non-ignorable kill" signal.
