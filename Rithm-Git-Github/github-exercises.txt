{ GitHub Exercises. }


Part I
Let's start by taking a bit of time to practice the git workflow below. It is so valuable to just practice this workflow a couple times, since you will most likely doing it professionally as well as in your individual projects and open source contributions. Here are some things to do.

-Create a local repository and add and commit some files

mkdir test_repo
touch test.txt
echo hello > test.txt
mv test.txt test_repo
cd test_repo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"

-Create a remote repository and push your code from the local repo to the remote

git push origin master

-Fork the repo https://github.com/rithmschool/git_practice - clone it and submit a pull request


-Create a new branch locally and push it to GitHub

git checkout -b another_branch

-Submit a pull request with your new branch against the master branch on the git_practice repo.
