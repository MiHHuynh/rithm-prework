Javascript Intro Exercises

What is the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript?
Javascript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standards. The standard dictates certain features and sets of functionality, but there can be different implementations that follow the standard. There are many different JavaScript engines that implement the ECMAScript standard and are competing for dominance.

Who is Brendan Eich?
Eich is the creator of Javascript.

How do you hide and show the Chrome console?
On Mac: Option + Command + J

Create a simple page with a script tag. Inside of the script tag declare a couple of variables and then log their values to the console.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>Simple Webpage</title>
	<script>
		var number1 = 1;
		var number2 = 2;
		console.log(number1);
		console.log(number2);
	</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

Variables and Primitives Exercises

Create the following variables
name, which is a string set to your current name
dayOfBirth, which is a number set to the day of your birth month

var name = "Michelle";
var dayOfBirth = 12;
_____

See what happens when you have multiple variables of the same name. Which one takes precedence?
The last one takes precendence since the document is read from top to bottom.
_____

Write some JavaScript that prompt's the user for their favorite color.
Once the user has submitted a favorite color, log that color to the console along with a friendly message.
var favColor = prompt("What is your favorite color?");
console.log("Your favorite color is " + favColor + ". Cool!");
_____

var quotes = "\"She said to me, \'What?\'\""
_____

What is the difference between null and undefined?
Null is the representation of nothingness, so a variable with null is assigned specifically a non-value. Undefined is the absence of any kind of value.
_____

What is NaN in JavaScript? What is the typeof NaN?
NaN is "not a number." It usually occurs when math functions done on a variable don't return a proper number. The type of NaN is "number."
_____

You can declare a variable by typing var thing;. What is the value of thing?
thing is undeclared.

{ Boolean Logic Exercises. }

Part I
Write down what the following statements will return. Try to figure this out before putting the commands in the chrome console.

1. 2 == "2"; >> true
2. 2 === 2; >> true
3. 10 % 3; >> 1
4. 10 % 3 === 1; >> true
5. true && false; >> false
6. false || true; >> true
7. true || false; >> true

Part II
Answer the following questions about this code block:

var isLearning = true;
if(isLearning){
    console.log("Keep it up!");
} else {
    console.log("Pretty sure you are learning....");
}
What should the above code console.log?

>>It should say "Keep it up!"

Why do we not need to specify if(isLearning === true)? Why does if(isLearning) work on its own?

isLearning is equivalent to True, which gets coerced into a boolean.
_____

var firstVariable;
var secondVariable = "";
var thirdVariable = 1;
var secretMessage = "Shh!";

if(firstVariable){
    console.log("first");
} else if(firstVariable || secondVariable){
    console.log("second");
} else if(firstVariable || thirdVariable){
    console.log("third");
} else {
    console.log("fourth");
}
What should the above code console.log? Why?

The code above should console.log "third." firstVariable is undefined, which is a falsey value, so the first if block will be ignored. For the second else-if, the condition is (firstVariable || secondVariable). When using the ||/or, one true value or two true values will make the entire condition true, while two false values will make it false. Both firstVariable and secondVariable are falsey values at undefined and "" respectively, thus the condition registers false. The second else-if block is then ignored as well. In the third else-if block, (firstVariable || thirdVariable), thirdVariable is 1, which, when converted to a boolean, is True. Thus, the condition will be true, and "third" will be logged to the console.

What is the value of firstVariable when it is initialized?

firstVariable is undefined when initialized.

Is the value of firstVariable a "truthy" value? Why?

firstVariable is not a "truthy" value because undefined will always be false.

Is the value of secondVariable a "truthy" value? Why?

secondVariable is not a "truthy" value because "" will always be false.

Is the value of thirdVariable a "truthy" value? Why?

thirdVariable is a "truthy" value because the number version of the boolean True is 1.

Part III
Research Math.random here and write an if statement that console.log's "Over 0.5" if Math.random returns a number greater than 0.5. Otherwise console.log "Under 0.5".

Math.random gives a random value between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
	console.log("Over 0.5");
} else {
	console.log("Under 0.5");
}


What is a falsey value? List all the falsey values in JavaScript.

A falsey value is one that always turns into a boolean false when coerced into a boolean. They are:
0
null
false
undefined
""
NaN
