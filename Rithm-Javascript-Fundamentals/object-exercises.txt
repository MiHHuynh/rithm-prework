Object Basics Exercises
-Create an object that has your firstName, lastName, and occupation as keys.
var myObj = {
	firstName = "Michelle",
	lastName = "Huynh",
	occupation = "Web Designer"
};

-Access each value from your object using both dot notation and bracket notation.
myObj.firstName;
myObj["firstName"];
myObj.lastName;
myObj["lastName"];
myObj.occupation;
myObj["occupation"];

-Add a key for hobby to your object. Remove the key and value for occupation.
myObj.hobby = "swimming";
delete myObj.occupation;

-What is the difference between dot notation and bracket notation?
Bracket notation always works. You can use it to evaluate an expression or use it with keys that aren't valid JS names.
Dot notation looks cleaner and more concise, but will not always work if you want to evaluate an expression or if the key name
is not straightforward (like a number).

Object Iteration Exercises

-Given the following object below, write code to print the value then the key to the console separated by '=>':

var namesAndHobbies = {
    elie: "JavaScript",
    matt: "jogging",
    janey: "table building",
    tim: "sailing"
}

// Output should be:
// JavaScript => elie
// jogging => matt
// table building => janey
// sailing => tim

for (var singleKey in namesAndHobbies) {
	console.log(namesAndHobbies[singleKey] + " => " + singleKey);
}

-Add a key for your name, and a value for your favorite hobby to the namesAndHobbies object.
namesAndHobbies["michelle"] = "swimming";

-Write an if statement that console.logs your name and hobby to the console if the key of your name is contained in the object.
if ("michelle" in namesAndHobbies) {
	console.log("michelle" + " " + namesAndHobbies["michelle"]);
}

For each of the exercises below, assume you are starting with the following programming object.

var programming = {
    languages: ["JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"],
    isChallenging: true,
    isRewarding: true,
    difficulty: 8,
    jokes: "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/234075/what-is-your-best-programmer-joke"
};

-Write the command to add the language "Go" to the end of the languages array.
programming.language.push("Go");

-Change the difficulty to the value of 7.
programming.difficulty = 7;

-Using the delete keyword, write the command to remove the jokes key from the programming object.
delete programming.jokes;

-Write the command to add a new key called isFun and a value of true to the programming object.
programming.isFun = true;

-Using a loop, iterate through the languages array and console.log all of the languages.
for (var i = 0; i < programming.languages.length; i++) {
	console.log(programming.languages[i]);
}

-Using a loop, console.log all of the keys in the programming object.
for (var k in programming) {
	console.log(k);
}

-Using a loop, console.log all of the values in the programming object.
for (var k in programming) {
	console.log(programming[k]);
}
